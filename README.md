Read "The Dune Country" via scrolling the whole freaking thing.

If you came here to read Dune by Frank Herbert, it's not public domain, yet. Sorry.

This project is a demonstration of a simple website to by deployed using Github Pages.

See [this article](https://ddrscott.github.io/blog/2023/how-to-make-a-website-via-github/) about how to use it.

## Running Locally

```sh
# Using Node JS
npm -i --global live-server

live-server docs

# OR Using Python

python3 -m http.server -d docs
```

## Future Features

As an exercise to do at home:

- Pick up were you left off, because no one can finish this book in a single sitting.
- Auto-scroll based on momentum of initial drag scroll.
- Change font size.
